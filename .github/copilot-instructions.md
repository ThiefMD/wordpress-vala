This is a Vala based repository for interacting with a Wordpress blog REST API and XML-RPC API. We aim for a casual laid back atmosphere, but deliver serious and reliable code.

Please follow these guidelines when contributing:

## General

  * Be respectful and considerate in your interactions with others.
  * Write clear and concise commit messages.
  * Follow the existing code style and conventions.
  * Prefer small, focused changes that are easy to review.
  * Include tests for any new features or bug fixes.
  * Document your code where necessary. Comments should help readers and middle school level understand the code.

## Repository Structure

  * `src/`: Contains the source code for the application.
    * Wordpress.vala: Compiles for libsoup2.4
    * Wordpress3.vala: Compiles for libsoup3
    * WordpressRest.vala: Compiles for libsoup2.4
    * WordpressRest3.vala: Compiles for libsoup3

## Key Guidelines

1. Follow Vala best practices and patterns.
2. Maintain existing code structure and organization.
3. Avoid large refactors unless explicitly requested.
4. Ensure that new code is well-tested and does not break existing functionality.
5. Use descriptive variable and function names that contain a fun tone or sense of humor.
6. Keep comments short, clear, and easy for a middle school reader.
7. When in doubt, ask for feedback or clarification from the maintainers.
8. Have fun and enjoy contributing to the project!

## Testing

  * Add or update tests under `tests/` for new behavior.
  * When you change a feature, update any affected test expectations.
  * If tests are not possible, explain why and what was verified manually.

## Style Notes

  * Prefer ASCII text unless the file already uses non-ASCII characters.
  * Keep naming consistent with nearby code.
  * Avoid introducing new dependencies unless requested.
